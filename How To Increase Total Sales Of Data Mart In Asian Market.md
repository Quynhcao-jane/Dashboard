**HOW TO INCREASE TOTAL SALES OF DATA MART IN ASIAN MARKET**

Background: Data Mart is Dannyâ€™s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyse his sales performance.

Data: The data is from [case study #5](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-5/) of 8weeksqlchallenge.
I've already solved the challenge [here](https://github.com/Quynhcao-jane/SQL-Project/tree/main/8%20Week%20SQL%20Challenge/Case%20Study%20%235%20-%20Data%20Mart), so in this one I want to visualize and analyze Asian Market sales performance and give some suggestions to increase total sales for the next year.

Notice: In this context, guest means the customers who came to the store a few times and didn't leave their information, like sign up for memebership. New customers means the customers came to the store the first time and signed up for membership. Because in the case study doesn't mention that so I will define the meaning that way.

**#1. From this dashboard, we can see:**

- Asian market has the 2nd largest amount of transactions but the average value of each transaction is the lowest
- Customer types are mainly guest and existing, and their demographic are mostly retired families or retired couples

**#2. Suggestions for increasing total sales in Asian Market:**

To increase total sales, Data Mart can increase the number of transactions or the average value of each transaction.

1. Increase the number of transactions
 
Increase the number of customers:

- Besides retaining existing customers, Data Mart can focus on increasing the number of guests and new customers
- Guests: Offline marketing activities, POSM displays and online marketings to target groups of people in that region
- New customers: Focus on the online channels, because offline marketing activities targeting the guests also have an impact on the new customer group

Increase the number of purchases of existing customers and guests: Add a variety of products with the affordable price to increase the need or satisfy their need

2. Increase the average value of each transaction

Some promotions, such as:

- Buy a minimum order to get discount. Example: 5-7% discount for orders over $40, freeship, cashback, etc.
- Buy products in bulk to get discount. Example: Buy more than 2 products, get $5 off
- Buy a combination of products to get a discount. For example: You want to a shampoo, if you add shower gel/conditioner products, you wlill get 5% off for those products
